 libelf (ELF object file access library) 
 
 Libelf lets you read, modify or create ELF files in an architecture 
 independent way. The library takes care of size and endian issues, 
 so for example you can process a file for SPARC processors on an 
 Intel based system. GCC uses libelf for LTO (Link Time Optimization).
