 sdparm (fetch and change SCSI attributes) 
 
 sdparm is a utility for listing and potentially changing SCSI disk 
 parameters. More generally it can be used on any device that uses 
 a SCSI command set. Apart from SCSI disks, examples of devices that 
 use SCSI command sets are ATAPI CD/DVD drives, SCSI and ATAPI tape 
 drives and SCSI enclosures. 
 
 sdparm was written by Douglas Gilbert.
