 luit (character encoding convertor for X11 terminals) 
 
 Luit is a filter that can be run between an arbitrary application and 
 a UTF-8 terminal emulator such as xterm. It will convert application 
 output from the locale's encoding into UTF-8, and convert terminal 
 input from UTF-8 into the locale's encoding.
