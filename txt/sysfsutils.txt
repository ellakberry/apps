 sysfsutils (Utilities for the sysfs filesystem) 
 
 The purpose of this package is to provide a set of utilities for 
 interfacing with sysfs, a virtual filesystem in Linux kernel versions 
 2.6+ that provides a tree of system devices. While a filesystem is a 
 very useful interface, a library (libsysfs) is also included that 
 will hopefully make it easier for applications to query system 
 devices and their attributes.
