 libtermcap (GNU termcap library) 
 
 This is the GNU termcap library -- a library of C functions that 
 enable programs to send control strings to terminals in a way 
 independent of the terminal type. Most of this package is also 
 distributed with GNU Emacs, but it is available in this separate 
 distribution to make it easier to install as -ltermcap.
