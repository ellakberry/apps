 dc3dd (version of dd designed for computer forensics) 
 
 dc3dd is a patched version of GNU dd to include a number of features 
 useful for computer forensics. Many of these features were inspired by 
 dcfldd, but were rewritten for dc3dd. Added features include robust 
 error handling, logging, progress meter, image verification, split 
 output and more.
