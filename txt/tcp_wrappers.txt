 tcp_wrappers (TCP/IP daemon wrapper library and utilities) 
 
 With this package you can monitor and filter incoming requests for 
 network services for access control, and detection things like host 
 name spoofing and host address spoofing. Nearly all the network 
 daemons on Slackware are "wrapped" using this library, and most 
 daemons in /etc/inetd.conf use tcp_wrappers' tcpd wrapper daemon. 
 If you plan to do much networking, you will need tcp_wrappers.
