 eject (a tool to eject removable media) 
 
 Eject allows removable media (typically a DVD, CD, floppy disk, tape, 
 etc.) to be ejected under software control. The command can also 
 control some multi-disc changers, the auto-eject feature supported by 
 some devices, and can close the disc tray of some drives. 
 
 The 'eject' program was written by Jeff Tranter.
