 libatasmart (ATA S.M.A.R.T. library) 
 
 libatasmart is a lean, small and clean implementation of an ATA 
 S.M.A.R.T. ((Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) 
 reading and parsing library. S.M.A.R.T. is a system used by hard 
 drives to monitor factors that may impact drive reliability in the 
 hope of predicting a drive failure before it occurs.
