 automake (a Makefile generator) 
 
 This is Automake, a Makefile generator. It was inspired by the 4.4BSD 
 make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the 
 GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets. Automake is a Perl 
 script. The input files are called Makefile.am. The output files are 
 called Makefile.in; they are intended for use with Autoconf. Automake 
 requires certain things to be done in your configure.in. You must 
 install the "m4" and "perl" packages to be able to use automake.
