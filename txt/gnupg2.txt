 GnuPG2 (The GNU Privacy Guard version 2.x) 
 
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage. It can 
 be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures. It includes 
 an advanced key management facility and is compliant with the proposed 
 OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC2440 and the S/MIME 
 standard as described by several RFCs. 
 
 GnuPG 2.0 is the stable version of GnuPG integrating support for 
 OpenPGP and S/MIME. It does not conflict with an installed 1.4.x 
 OpenPGP-only version.
