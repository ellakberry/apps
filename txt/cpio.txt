 cpio (backup and archiving utility) 
 
 This is GNU cpio, a program to manage archives of files. This package 
 also includes mt, a tape drive control program. cpio copies files into 
 or out of a cpio or tar archive, which is a file that contains other 
 files plus information about them, such as their pathname, owner, 
 timestamps, and access permissions. The archive can be another file on 
 the disk, a magnetic tape, or a pipe.
