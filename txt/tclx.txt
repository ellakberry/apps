 tclx (Extended Tcl) 
 
 Extended Tcl (TclX), is a set of extensions to Tcl, the Tool Command 
 Language invented by Dr. John Ousterhout. Extended Tcl is oriented 
 towards Unix system programming tasks and large application 
 development. Many additional interfaces to the Unix operating system 
 are provided. Extended Tcl was designed and implemented by Karl 
 Lehenbauer (karl@NeoSoft.com) and Mark Diekhans (markd@Grizzly.com), 
 with help in the early stages from Peter da Silva (peter@NeoSoft.com).
