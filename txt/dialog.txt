 dialog (display dialog boxes from shell scripts) 
 
 Dialog is a program to present a variety of questions or display 
 messages using dialog boxes from a shell script. The Slackware 
 package management script "pkgtool" uses this, as do various other 
 menu-driven console scripts. 
 
 Dialog was originally contributed to Slackware by Savio Lam, and has 
 been contributed to by many. Dialog is currently maintained by 
 Thomas E. Dickey.
