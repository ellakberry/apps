 glade3 (Glade UI Designer version 3) 
 
 Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick and easy development of user 
 interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. 
 The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using 
 the GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications 
 dynamically as needed.
