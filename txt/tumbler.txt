 tumbler (thumbnail generator) 
 
 Tumbler is a D-Bus service for applications to request thumbnails 
 for various URI schemes and MIME types. It is written in an object- 
 oriented fashion using GLib and GObject. It provides plugin 
 interfaces for extending the URI schemes and MIME types for which 
 thumbnails can be generated as well as for replacing the storage 
 backend that is used to store the thumbnails on disk.
