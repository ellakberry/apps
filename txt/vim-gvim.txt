 vim-gvim (gvim, the X/GTK2 enabled version of vim) 
 
 Gvim is a graphical version of vim. Vim is an almost compatible 
 version of the UNIX editor vi. Many new features have been added, 
 such as multi level undo, command line history, filename completion, 
 block operations, and more. 
 
 The main vim package in the AP series is required to use this package. 
 
 Vim's development is led by Bram Moolenaar.
