 netpipes (TCP/IP pipe utilities) 
 
 Robert Forsman's netpipes package makes TCP/IP streams usable in shell 
 scripts. It can also simplify client/server code by allowing the 
 programmer to skip all the tedious programming bits related to sockets 
 and concentrate on writing a filter/service. Here's an example of 
 what you can do with 'faucet' and 'hose', two netpipes commands: 
 
 server$ faucet 3000 -out tar cf - . 
 client$ hose server 3000 -in tar xvf -
