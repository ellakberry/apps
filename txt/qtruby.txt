 qtruby (Qt bindings for ruby) 
 
 QtRuby is part of Korundum, very complete bindings to both the KDE 
 API and the Qt APIs. The Korundum package includes both a QtRuby 
 Qt-only binding along with the full combined Qt/KDE one. 
 The QtRuby package contains just Qt bindings, with no dependency 
 on KDE.
