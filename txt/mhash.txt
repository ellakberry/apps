 mhash (Thread-safe hash library) 
 
 mhash is a thread-safe hash library, implemented in C, and provides a 
 uniform interface to a large number of hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, 
 HAVAL, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD160, TIGER, GOST). These algorithms can be 
 used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures. 
 The HMAC support implements the basics for message authentication, 
 following RFC 2104.
