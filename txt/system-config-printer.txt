 system-config-printer (CUPS printer administration tool) 
 
 The purpose of the tool is to configure a CUPS server (often the local 
 machine) using the CUPS API. The tool is written in Python, using 
 pygtk for the graphical parts and Python bindings (pycups) for the 
 CUPS API. It is largely the same as using the CUPS web interface for 
 configuring printers, but has the advantage of being a native 
 application rather than a web page.
