 lvm2 (Logical Volume Manager version 2) 
 
 Heinz Mauelshagen's LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for Linux. 
 LVM adds an additional layer between the physical peripherals and the 
 low-level I/O interface to get a logical view of disks. This allows 
 the concatenation of several disks (so-called physical volumes or PVs) 
 to form a storage pool (so-called Volume Group or VG) with allocation 
 units called physical extents (called PE). With LVM, you can extend, 
 resize, or relocate storage dynamically.
