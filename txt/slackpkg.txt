 slackpkg 
 
 Slackpkg is a package manager for Slackware. It can download, 
 upgrade, install and remove selected packages. With it, you 
 can search in the Slackware Package database and find which 
 package has the selected file. 
 
 Slackpkg DOESN'T replace pkgtool. Actually, Slackpkg uses pkgtool 
 for all install|upgrade|remove functions.
