 slocate (Secure Locate) 
 
 Slocate is an enhanced version of locate, a command to help you locate 
 files on the system. Like the original version of locate, Slocate 
 maintains a database of files on the system, updating it nightly. 
 Unlike the original, Slocate indexes every file on the machine rather 
 than only the ones that can be seen by everyone. The "secure" part of 
 slocate is that it will only return matches if the user is allowed to 
 see the files.
