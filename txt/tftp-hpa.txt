 tftp-hpa (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) 
 
 The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is normally used only for 
 booting diskless workstations (or the Slackware installer). The tftp 
 package provides the user interface for TFTP, which allows users to 
 transfer files to and from a remote machine. This program and TFTP 
 provide very little security, and should not be enabled unless it is 
 expressly needed. 
 
 tftp-hpa is maintained by H. Peter Anvin.
