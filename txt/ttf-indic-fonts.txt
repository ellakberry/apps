 ttf-indic-fonts (Fonts for Indic scripts) 
 
 This is a collection of free fonts that support some of the more 
 widely used Indic scripts. Included are TTF fonts for Bengali, 
 Devanagari, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, 
 and Telugu. 
 
 For more information about enabling full Indic support (this package 
 will enable display, but probably not input), see the 
 Indic-Fonts-HOWTO which can be found in /usr/doc/Linux-HOWTOs.
