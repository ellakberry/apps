 gcc-objc (Objective-C support for GCC) 
 
 Objective-C support for the GNU Compiler Collection. 
 
 This package contains those parts of the compiler collection needed to 
 compile code written in Objective-C. Objective-C was originally 
 developed to add object-oriented extensions to the C language, and is 
 best known as the native language of the NeXT computer. 
 
 The base gcc package is also required.
