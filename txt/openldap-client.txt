 openldap-client (OpenLDAP client programs) 
 
 OpenLDAP is an open source implementation of the Lightweight 
 Directory Access Protocol. LDAP is a alternative to the X.500 
 Directory Access Protocol (DAP). It uses the TCP/IP stack versus 
 the overly complex OSI stack. 
 
 LDAP is often used to provide authentication (such as for email).
