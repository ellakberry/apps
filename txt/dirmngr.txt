 CRL (Certificate Revocation Lists Manager) 
 
 Dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading certificate 
 revocation lists (CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for downloading 
 the certificates themselves. Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests as 
 an alternative to CRLs. Dirmngr is either invoked internally by 
 gpgsm (from gnupg 2.x) or when running as a system daemon through 
 the dirmngr-client tool.
