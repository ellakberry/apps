 automake (a Makefile generator) auto
 auto
 This is Automake, a Makefile generator. It was inspired by the 4.4BSD auto
 make and include files, but aims to be portable and to conform to the auto
 GNU standards for Makefile variables and targets. Automake is a Perl auto
 script. The input files are called Makefile.am. The output files are auto
 called Makefile.in; they are intended for use with Autoconf. Automake auto
 requires certain things to be done in your configure.in. You must auto
 install the "m4" and "perl" packages to be able to use automake. auto

 CMake (cross-platform, open-source make system) c
 c
 CMake is used to control the software process using simple platform c
 and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates c
 native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the c
 compiler environment of your choice. c

 CMake's home on the web is: http://www.cmake.org c

 make (GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs) 
 
 This is the GNU implementation of make, which was written by Richard 
 Stallman and Roland McGrath. The purpose of the make utility is to 
 determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be 
 recompiled, and issue the commands to recompile them. 
 
 This is needed to compile just about any major C program, including 
 the Linux kernel.

 pmake (BSD parallel make) p
 p
 This is PMake -- a parallel Make program originally written for the p
 Sprite operating system, ported from BSD Unix. This may be useful if p
 you're going to port software with Makefiles designed for BSD. p
 p
 PMake was written by Adam de Boor. p
