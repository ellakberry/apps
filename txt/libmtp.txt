 libmtp (A library for MTP media devices) 
 
 libmtp is a library that attempts to support Microsoft's Media 
 Transfer Protocol (MTP). It was initially based on the great libptp2 
 library by Mariusz Woloszyn now maintained by Marcus Meissners, and 
 Hubert Figuere's libgphoto2 work based on libptp2 (or is libptp2 
 based on libgphoto?). It is like a master DJ has remixed all of 
 these tracks and then added a new API adapted for portable media 
 players. :-)
