 pciutils (PCI utilities) 
 
 lspci displays detailed information about all PCI buses and devices 
 in the system, replacing the original /proc/pci interface. 
 
 setpci allows reading from and writing to PCI device configuration 
 registers. For example, you can adjust the latency timers with it. 
 
 See the manual pages for more details.
