 libmad (high-quality MPEG audio library) 
 
 MAD (libmad) is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently 
 supports MPEG-1 and the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling 
 Frequencies, as well as the so-called MPEG 2.5 format. All three 
 audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III a.k.a. MP3) are 
 fully implemented. Because MAD provides full 24-bit PCM output, 
 applications using MAD are able to produce high quality audio. 
 MAD is distributed under the terms of the GPL. 
 
 MAD (libmad) was written by Robert Leslie.
