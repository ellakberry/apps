 aaa_elflibs (shared libraries needed by many programs) 
 
 This is a collection of shared libraries needed to run Linux programs. 
 ELF (Executable and Linking Format) is the standard Linux binary 
 format. These libraries are gathered from other Slackware packages 
 and are intended to give a fairly complete initial set of libraries. 
 This package should be not upgraded or reinstalled (it could copy 
 over newer library versions).
