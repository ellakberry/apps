 libao (Audio Output library) 
 
 Libao is a cross-platform audio library, and is required by many 
 programs and other libraries that use audio (some examples include 
 ogg123, GAIM, and the Ogg Vorbis libraries). This package provides 
 plugins for OSS, ESD, aRts, and ALSA. You will need to install the 
 supporting libraries for any plugins you want to use.
