 gptfdisk (GPT fdisk utilities) 
 
 GPT fdisk (consisting of the gdisk, cgdisk, sgdisk, and fixparts 
 programs) is a set of text-mode partitioning tools for using a GPT 
 (GUID Partition Table), rather than the traditional MBR (Master Boot 
 Record) partition tables. It features several partitioning tools, 
 recovery tools to help you deal with corrupt partition tables, and the 
 ability to convert MBR disks to GPT format.
