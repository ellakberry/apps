 netatalk (Appletalk file and print server) 
 
 Netatalk is an Appletalk file and print server for Linux. Using 
 Netatalk, Macintosh computers on your local network can mount Linux 
 volumes as if they were standard Appletalk network drives, and can 
 print to the Linux box's printer as if it were a network printer 
 supporting PostScript. 
 
 Netatalk was originally written by the Research Systems Unix Group at 
 The University of Michigan, and is maintained by the Netatalk Team.
