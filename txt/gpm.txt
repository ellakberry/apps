 gpm (general purpose mouse server) 
 
 The general purpose mouse server, or gpm, allows you to use the mouse 
 to cut and paste text from the screen. It also acts as a mouse 
 server for applications running on the Linux console, such as the 
 Midnight Commander file manager. 
 
 NOTE: This program may cause problems when you start X on systems 
 that use a bus mouse (not common). If you get an 'unable to open 
 mouse device' error from X, disable /etc/rc.d/rc.gpm.
