 netdate (simple network time utility) 
 
 Netdate takes a list of names of Internet hosts as arguments, selects 
 the one which supplies the best time, and sets the system time 
 accordingly. The invoker must be the super-user for the time to be 
 set. Protocol names (either udp or tcp) may be interspersed with the 
 host names, and determine the protocol which will be used to connect 
 to the hosts whose names follow, up to the next protocol name or the 
 end of the arguments. The default protocol is udp. 
 
 These days, "ntpdate" is probably a better choice.
