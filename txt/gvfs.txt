 gvfs (glib virtual filesystems) 
 
 gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the I/O 
 abstractions of libgio (a library included in the glib2 package). 
 It installs several modules that are automatically used by applications 
 that use the libgio API. There is also fuse support that allows 
 applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems.
