 sharutils (GNU shell archive packing utilities) 
 
 `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing 
 them for transmission by electronic mail services. `unshar' helps 
 unpacking shell archives after reception. `uuencode' prepares a file 
 for transmission over an electronic channel which ignores or otherwise 
 mangles the eight bit (high order bit) of bytes. `uudecode' does the 
 converse transformation. `remsync' allows for remote synchronization 
 of directory trees using electronic mail.
