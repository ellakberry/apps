 git (the stupid content tracker) 
 
 Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an 
 unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations 
 and full access to internals. 
 
 "git" can mean anything, depending on your mood. 
 
 Git was originally written by Linus Torvalds and is currently 
 maintained by Junio C. Hamano.
