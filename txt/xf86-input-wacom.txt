 xf86-input-wacom (driver for Wacom tablets) 
 
 This package provides the X.Org X11 driver for Wacom and Wacom-like 
 tablets. It obsoletes the linuxwacom driver and supports X server 
 versions 1.7 and higher. Server versions lower than 1.7 may be 
 supported by this driver, but users are encouraged to use the old 
 linuxwacom driver instead.
