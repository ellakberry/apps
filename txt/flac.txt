 flac (Free Lossless Audio Codec) 
 
 FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. Grossly oversimplified, 
 FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless. "Free" means that the 
 specification of the stream format is in the public domain, and that 
 neither the FLAC format nor any of the implemented encoding/decoding 
 methods are covered by any patent. It also means that the sources for 
 libFLAC and libFLAC++ are available under the LGPL and the sources for 
 flac, metaflac, and the plugins are available under the GPL. 
 
 FLAC was developed by Josh Coalson.
