 patch (apply a diff file to an original file or files) 
 
 Patch is a utility used to apply diffs (or patches) to files, which 
 are usually source code. 
 
 Larry Wall wrote the original version of patch. Paul Eggert removed 
 patch's arbitrary limits; added support for binary files, setting 
 file times, and deleting files; and made it conform better to POSIX. 
 Other contributors include Wayne Davison, who added unidiff support, 
 and David MacKenzie, who added configuration and backup support.
