 procmail (mail processing and local delivery program) 
 
 Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming 
 mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to 
 one or more mailing lists or for prioritizing your mail), preprocess 
 your mail, start any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate 
 different chimes on your workstation for different types of mail) or 
 selectively forward certain incoming mail automatically to someone. 
 Procmail is required by sendmail to deliver the local mail. 
 The author of procmail is Stephen R. van den Berg.
