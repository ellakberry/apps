 parted (GNU disk partitioning tool) 
 
 GNU Parted is a program for creating, destroying, resizing, checking 
 and copying partitions, and the filesystems on them. This is useful 
 for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk 
 usage, copying data between hard disks, and disk imaging.
