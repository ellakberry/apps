 xorg-server-xvfb (virtual framebuffer X server) 
 
 Xvfb is an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware 
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using 
 virtual memory. The primary use of this server is intended to be 
 server testing. The mfb or cfb code for any depth can be exercised 
 with this server without the need for real hardware that supports the 
 desired depths. A secondary use is testing clients against unusual 
 depths and screen configurations.
