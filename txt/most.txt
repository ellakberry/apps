 most (another pager, like 'more' and 'less') 
 
 most is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the 
 contents of a file on a terminal. Unlike other well-known paging 
 programs, most supports multiple windows and can scroll left and 
 right. Why settle for less? 
 
 'most' was written by John E. Davis.
