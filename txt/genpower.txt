 genpower (UPS monitoring daemon) 
 
 The genpower daemon, genpowerd, will monitor the status of a serial 
 line connected to a UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply). If a power 
 failure is detected, genpowerd will notify the system to take the 
 needed steps to react to the condition of the UPS. This may include 
 shutting the system down, or canceling a pending shutdown if the 
 power is restored.
