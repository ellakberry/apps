 mc (Midnight Commander file manager) 
 
 The Midnight Commander is a Norton Commander clone, a program that 
 manipulates and manages files and directories. Useful, fast, and has 
 color displays on the Linux console. Mouse support is provided 
 through the gpm mouse server. This is a lightweight compilation of 
 mc for use on the text console or in an xterm. 
 
 mc was written by Miguel de Icaza and Mauricio Plaza.
