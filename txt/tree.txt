 tree (a program to display a directory tree) 
 
 Tree is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth 
 indented listing of files, which is colorized ala dircolors if the 
 LS_COLORS environment variable is set and output is to tty. With no 
 arguments, tree lists the files in the current directory. 
 
 The tree utility was written by Steve Baker.
