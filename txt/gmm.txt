 gmm (C++ generic matrix template library) 
 
 Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and skyline 
 matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms (mult, add, copy, 
 sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers, etc.) for any interfaced vector 
 type or matrix type. It can be viewed as a glue library that allows 
 cooperation between several vector and matrix types. However, basic 
 sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types are built in Gmm++, so 
 it can be used as a standalone linear algebra library.
