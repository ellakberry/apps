 GStreamer (streaming multimedia framework) 
 
 GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of a 
 media-handling components, ranging from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback 
 to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing. 
 Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter 
 technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters 
 by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. 
 
 GStreamer is released under the LGPL.
