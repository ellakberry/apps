 cifs-utils (CIFS filesystem utilities) 
 
 This is the release version of cifs-utils, a package of utilities for 
 doing and managing mounts of the Linux CIFS filesystem. The in-kernel 
 CIFS filesystem is generally the preferred method for mounting 
 SMB/CIFS shares on Linux. This filesystem relies on a set of 
 user-space tools that were originally part of Samba, but have now been 
 split off into this separate package.
