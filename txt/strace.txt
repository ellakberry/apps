 strace (trace system calls and signals) 
 
 Strace allows you to trace the execution of a command. It runs the 
 specified command until it exits, intercepting signals and system 
 calls and dumping the information to the standard error. System 
 administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it 
 invaluable for solving problems with programs for which the source 
 is not readily available since they do not need to be recompiled in 
 order to trace them.
