 xz (compression utility based on the LZMA algorithm) 
 
 LZMA is a general purpose compression algorithm designed by Igor 
 Pavlov as part of 7-Zip. It provides high compression ratio while 
 keeping the decompression speed fast. XZ Utils are an attempt to make 
 LZMA compression easy to use on free (as in freedom) operating 
 systems. 
 
 The people most responsible for xz are Igor Pavlov, Ville Koskinen, 
 and Lasse Collin. For more info: http://tukaani.org/xz/
