 libktorrent (Protocol library for the KDE BitTorrent program) 
 
 Libktorrent is the BitTorrent protocol library for ktorrent, which 
 contains all the torrent downloading code. Although it is closely 
 to ktorrent, the goal is to make libktorrent an independent 
 library which can be used by other applications.
