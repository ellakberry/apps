 pkg-config (system for managing library compile/link flags) 
 
 pkg-config is a system for managing library compile/link flags 
 that works with automake and autoconf. It replaces the ubiquitous 
 *-config scripts you may have seen with a single tool. See the man 
 page that comes with pkg-config for full documentation.
