 gutenprint (IJS printer driver for Ghostscript and CUPS) 
 
 Gutenprint (formerly named Gimp-Print) is a suite of printer drivers 
 that may be used with most common print spooling systems, including 
 CUPS, LPRng, or others. These drivers provide high quality printing 
 in many cases equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied 
 drivers. Gutenprint also includes an enhanced print plug-in for the 
 GIMP image editor.
