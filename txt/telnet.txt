 telnet (the telnet client and daemon) 
 
 telnet supports the original DARPA telnet interactive communication 
 protocol. As connecting to a telnetd server transmits your password 
 over the network in cleartext, telnet's use as a login protocol has 
 been mostly superseded by the use of ssh and sshd. However, the 
 telnet client is still a very handy tool, and telnetd may still have 
 some uses on networks that are known to be secure. 
 
 telnet and telnetd were ported from BSD.
