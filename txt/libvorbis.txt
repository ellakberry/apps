 libvorbis (Ogg Vorbis library) 
 
 This library supports the Vorbis General Audio Compression Codec 
 (commonly known as Ogg Vorbis). Ogg Vorbis is a fully open, 
 non-proprietary, patent-and-royalty-free, general-purpose compressed 
 audio format for audio and music at fixed and variable bitrates. 
 
 The libvorbis library requires libao and libogg. You'll find some 
 basic tools for creating and using Ogg Vorbis files in the 
 vorbis-tools package.
