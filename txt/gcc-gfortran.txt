 gcc-gfortran (Fortran support for GCC) 
 
 The GNU Fortran compiler is fully compliant with the Fortran 95 
 Standard and includes legacy F77 support. In addition, a significant 
 number of Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008 features are implemented. 
 GNU Fortran also contains many standard and extensions and can be 
 used to run real-world programs. 
 
 This package contains those parts of the compiler collection 
 needed to compile Fortran code. The gcc package is also required.
