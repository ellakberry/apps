 lrzip (Long Range ZIP) 
 
 LRZIP is a file compression program designed to do particularly well 
 on very large files containing long distance redundancy. The larger 
 the file and the more memory you have, the better the compression 
 advantage this will provide. A variety of compression options allow 
 optimizing for size or speed.
