 acpid (ACPI daemon) 
 
 Most modern computers support the Advanced Configuration and Power 
 Interface (ACPI) standard to allow intelligent power management. 
 This package contains acpid, which is the user-space daemon needed in 
 order to make the Linux ACPI support completely functional. 
 
 ACPI must be compiled into the kernel to run acpid.
