 mtdev (multitouch device library) 
 
 mtdev is a stand-alone library which transforms all variants of 
 kernel MT events to the slotted type B protocol. The events put 
 into mtdev may be from any MT device, specifically type A without 
 contact tracking, type A with contact tracking, or type B with 
 contact tracking. 
 The bulk of the mtdev code has been out there since 2008 as part of 
 the Multitouch X Driver. With this package, finger tracking and 
 seamless MT protocol handling is available under a free license.
