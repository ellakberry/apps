 powertop (tool for analyzing system power usage) 
 
 PowerTOP is a utility that collects data from your system and presents 
 an overview to help optimize power savings. PowerTOP will identify 
 which tunables and software components are the biggest offenders in 
 slurping up your battery time. PowerTOP updates its display 
 frequently so that you can directly see the impact of any changes you 
 are making.
