 normalize (adjusts volume levels of audio files) 
 
 normalize is a tool for adjusting the volume of audio files to a 
 standard level. This is useful for things like creating mix CDs 
 from mp3 collections, where different recording levels on 
 different albums can cause the volume to vary greatly from song 
 to song. The package also contains an XMMS plugin.
