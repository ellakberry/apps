 CMake (cross-platform, open-source make system) 
 
 CMake is used to control the software process using simple platform 
 and compiler independent configuration files. CMake generates 
 native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the 
 compiler environment of your choice. 
 
 CMake's home on the web is: http://www.cmake.org
