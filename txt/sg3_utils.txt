 sg3_utils (utilities and test programs for the linux sg driver) 
 
 This package contains low level utilities for devices that use a SCSI 
 command set. Apart from SCSI parallel interface (SPI) devices, the 
 SCSI command set is used by ATAPI devices (CD/DVDs and tapes), USB 
 mass storage devices, Fibre Channel disks, IEEE 1394 storage devices 
 (that use the "SBP" protocol), SAS, iSCSI and FCoE devices (among 
 others).
