 oxygen-gtk2 (Oxygen GTK+ engine) 
 
 Oxygen-Gtk2 is a port of the KDE widget theme Oxygen, to GTK+. 
 It's primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between GTK+ and 
 qt-based applications running under kde. A secondary objective is 
 to also have a stand-alone nice looking GTK+ theme that would behave 
 well on other Desktop Environments. 
 Unlike other attempts made to port the kde oxygen theme to GTK+, this 
 attempt does not depend on Qt.
