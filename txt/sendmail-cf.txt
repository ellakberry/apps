 sendmail-cf (configuration files for sendmail) 
 
 These files are used to create sendmail.cf configuration files. The 
 m4 macro processor is also required in order to make use of these 
 files. 
 
 The files and documentation in /usr/share/sendmail should make it 
 possible to support virtually any mail configuration. NOTE: You 
 probably won't need this package if you're planning to use one of the 
 sendmail.cf samples included in the sendmail package.
