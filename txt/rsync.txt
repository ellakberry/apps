 rsync (remote file sync) 
 
 rsync is a replacement for rcp that has many more features. It 
 uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for 
 bringing remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the 
 differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both 
 sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand. 
 
 rsync was written by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras.
