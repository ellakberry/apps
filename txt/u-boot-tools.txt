 u-boot-tools (Tools for systems using the Das U-Boot Linux Loader) 
 
 This package contains the tools for working with a system that uses 
 the Das U-Boot Linux loader. This includes the mkimage utility, which 
 encapsulates a compressed "uImage" Linux kerel image with header 
 information, CRC32 checksum and so on. mkimage can also be used to 
 create ramdisk images for use with U-Boot, either separated from the 
 Linux kernel image, or combined into one file. 
 
 Also included are the tools to read and modify U-Boot's environment.
