 xfce4-volumed (audio volume management daemon) 
 
 This daemon is responsible for making the volume up/down and mute 
 keys of the keyboard work automatically, and uses the XFCE mixer's 
 defined card and track for choosing which track to act on. 
 
 It also provides volume change and mute toggle notifications if 
 a notification daemon is running (using libnotify).
