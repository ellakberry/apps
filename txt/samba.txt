 samba (CIFS file and print server) 
 
 Samba is a CIFS file and print server for CIFS clients. It allows 
 you to make file space or printers on a Samba host available to CIFS 
 clients (such as PCs running Windows). 
 
 If you have any Windows file servers, you may be able to replace them 
 or supplement them with Samba. One of Samba's big strengths is 
 integration, so you can use it to tie together your Linux hosts and 
 Windows PC clients.
