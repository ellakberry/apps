 udev (dynamic device directory system) 
 
 udev provides a dynamic device directory containing only the files 
 for the devices which are actually present. It creates or removes 
 device node files usually located in the /dev directory. 
 
 udev requires a 2.6 or newer kernel. 
 
 Kay Sievers is the udev maintainer.
