 gnutls (GNU TLS library) 
 
 This is a TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0 and SSL (Secure Sockets 
 Layer) 3.0 implementation. In brief, GnuTLS can be described as a 
 library which offers an API to access secure communication protocols. 
 These protocols provide privacy over insecure lines, and were designed 
 to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery.
