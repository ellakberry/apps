 electricsheep (distributed screensaver) 
 
 Electric Sheep is an xscreensaver module that displays mpeg video 
 of an animated fractal flame. In the background it contributes 
 render cycles to the next animation. Periodically it uploades 
 completed frames to the server, where they are compressed for 
 distribution to all clients. 
 This program is recommended only if you have a high bandwidth 
 connection to the internet such as DSL or cable modem.
