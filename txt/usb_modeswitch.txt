 usb_modeswitch (mode switching tool for multiple mode USB devices) 
 
 USB-ModeSwitch is (surprise!) a small mode switching tool for 
 controlling "flip flop" (multiple device) USB gear. These devices 
 initially appear to be USB storage, typically containing the MS 
 Windows drivers for whatever the real purpose of the device is, such 
 as a wireless USB modem. To use these devices with Linux, they need 
 to be told to switch out of storage mode, which is the purpose of the 
 USB-ModeSwitch utility.
