 gmm (C++ generic matrix template library) g
 g
 Gmm++ is a generic C++ template library for sparse, dense and skyline g
 matrices. It is built as a set of generic algorithms (mult, add, copy, g
 sub-matrices, dense and sparse solvers, etc.) for any interfaced vector g
 type or matrix type. It can be viewed as a glue library that allows g
 cooperation between several vector and matrix types. However, basic g
 sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types are built in Gmm++, so g
 it can be used as a standalone linear algebra library. g
 
 mm (Shared Memory Allocation library) 
 
 OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of 
 shared memory between forked processes. On the first layer it hides 
 all platform dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) 
 when dealing with shared memory segments and on the second layer it 
 provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API to work with data inside 
 those shared memory segments. Apache, PHP, and other projects use mm. 
 
 The mm library was written by Ralf S. Engelschall.
