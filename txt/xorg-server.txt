 xorg-server (The Xorg server, the core of the X Window System) 
 
 Xorg is a full featured X server that was originally designed for UNIX 
 and UNIX-like operating systems running on Intel x86 hardware. It now 
 runs on a wider range of hardware and OS platforms. This work was 
 derived by the X.Org Foundation from the XFree86 Project's XFree86 
 4.4rc2 release. The XFree86 release was originally derived from X386 
 1.2 by Thomas Roell which was contributed to X11R5 by Snitily Graphics 
 Consulting Service.
