 autofs (kernel-based automounter) 
 
 autofs is a kernel-based automounter for Linux. It performs a job 
 similar to amd(8) but relies on a small stub of kernel code instead of 
 pretending to be an NFS server. The result is simpler code, better 
 reliability, and much faster operation in the common case (everything 
 already mounted.)
