 libjpeg (Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software) 
 
 Software to implement JPEG image compression and decompression. JPEG 
 (pronounced 'jay-peg') is a standardized compression method for 
 full-color and gray-scale images. JPEG is intended for compressing 
 'real-world' scenes; cartoons and other non-realistic images are not 
 its strong suit. JPEG is lossy, however, on typical images of 
 real-world scenes, very good compression levels can be obtained with 
 no visible change, and amazingly high compression levels are possible 
 if you can tolerate a low-quality image.
