 rpm (RPM package format tool) 
 
 RPM is a tool from Red Hat Software used to install and remove 
 packages in the .rpm format. When installing RPM packages on 
 Slackware, you may need to use the --nodeps and --force options. 
 Before installing any binary package, it's wise to examine it to 
 see what it's going to do, and if it will overwrite any files. You 
 can use rpm2tgz to convert .rpm packages to .tgz packages so you 
 can look them over.
