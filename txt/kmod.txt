 kmod (kernel module tools and library) 
 
 kmod is a set of tools to handle common tasks with Linux kernel 
 modules like insert, remove, list, check properties, resolve 
 dependencies and aliases. The aim is to be compatible with the tools, 
 configurations and indexes from the module-init-tools project. 
 
 These tools are designed on top of libkmod, a library that is 
 shipped with kmod.
