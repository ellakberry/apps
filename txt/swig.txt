 swig (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) 
 
 SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and 
 C++ with scripting languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It 
 works by taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using 
 them to generate the wrapper code that scripting languages need to 
 access the underlying C/C++ code. In addition, SWIG provides a variety 
 of customization features that let you tailor the wrapping process to 
 suit your application.
