 NetworkManager (Networking that Just Works) 
 
 The point of NetworkManager is to make networking configuration and 
 setup as painless and automatic as possible. NetworkManager sets IP 
 addresses, default routes, associating with wireless access points 
 or wired LANs, and other network configuration settings in a simple, 
 automated fashion (manual overrides are still possible).
