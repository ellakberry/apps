 alsa-oss (library/wrapper to use OSS programs with ALSA) 
 
 The Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) provides audio and MIDI 
 functionality to the Linux operating system. OSS (Open Sound System) 
 is an older sound system for Linux that ALSA is replacing. Using 
 the aoss wrapper you can use programs that only support OSS with ALSA 
 without having to load the OSS compatibility kernel modules.
