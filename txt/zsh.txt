 zsh (the Z shell) 
 
 Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells 
 most resembles the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely 
 compatible. It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the 
 command-line editor, options for customizing its behavior, filename 
 globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and 
 extra features drawn from tcsh (another 'custom' shell). Zsh was 
 written by Paul Falstad.
