 xfsdump (backup tools for the XFS filesystem) 
 
 The xfsdump package contains the xfsdump and xfsrestore utilities for 
 backing up and restoring XFS partitions. xfsdump examines files in a 
 filesystem, determines which need to be backed up, and copies those 
 files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. xfsrestore 
 performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a full 
 or incremental backup of a filesystem.
