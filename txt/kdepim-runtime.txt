 kdepim-runtime (KDE Personal Information Management runtime) 
 
 The KDE-PIM project aims to bring together those who wish to help 
 design, implement, test, etc. anything that's to do with personal 
 information management. 
 
 This rather broad scope encompasses mail clients, addressbooks, 
 usenet news, scheduling, and even sticky notes.
