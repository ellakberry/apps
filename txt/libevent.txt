 libevent (event loop library) 
 
 libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event driven 
 network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() 
 and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the 
 event loop. The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a 
 callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or 
 after a timeout has been reached.
