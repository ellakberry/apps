 libcgroup (library and utilities for kernel control groups) 
 
 Control Groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of 
 tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with 
 specialized behaviour. It makes use of a filesystem interface. 
 This package contains a library for developing applications that use 
 control groups, as well as some basic userspace tools for controlling 
 and monitoring control groups.
