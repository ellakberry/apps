 getty-ps (console or terminal login) 
 
 /sbin/getty and /sbin/uugetty. 
 These control the process of logging into your system, and may be used 
 instead of 'agetty', which is the default getty included with the 
 util-linux package. getty-ps supports a number of enhancements such as 
 ringback support. 
 
 getty-ps was originally written by Paul Sutcliffe, Jr, and is 
 currently maintained by Christine Jamison.
