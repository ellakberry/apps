 distcc (distributed C/C++ compiler/daemon) 
 
 distcc allows compilation of C code to be distributed across several 
 machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same results 
 as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often 
 significantly faster than a local compile. 
 
 IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE: distccd should only run on trusted networks. 
 
 distcc was written by Martin Pool.
