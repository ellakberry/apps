 libmng (Multiple-image Network Graphics library) 
 
 This is libmng, the MNG reference library. MNG (pronounced 'ming'), 
 is short for Multiple-image Network Graphics. Designed with the same 
 modular philosophy as PNG and by many of the same people, MNG is 
 intended to provide a home for all of the multi-image (animation) 
 capabilities that have no place in PNG. 
 
 libmng was written by Gerard Juyn.
