 infozip (Info-ZIP's zip and unzip utilities) 
 
 zip is a compression and file packaging utility for Unix, VMS, MSDOS, 
 OS/2, Windows NT, Minix, Atari and Macintosh, Amiga and Acorn RISC OS. 
 It is analogous to a combination of the UNIX commands tar(1) and 
 compress(1) and is compatible with PKZIP (Phil Katz's ZIP). A 
 companion program (unzip(1L)), unpacks zip archives.
