 httpd (The Apache HTTP Server) 
 
 Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the 
 NCSA HTTP server. It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and 
 includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which 
 allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily. 
 
 Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over 
 half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of 
 its variants.
