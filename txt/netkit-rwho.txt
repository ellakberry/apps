 netkit-rwho (who is logged in on local machines) 
 
 The rwho command produces output similar to who, but for all machines 
 on the local network. If no report has been received from a machine 
 for 11 minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not 
 report users last known to be logged into that machine. If a users 
 hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then rwho reports 
 this idle time. If a user hasn't typed to the system for an hour or 
 more, then the user will be omitted from the output of rwho unless 
 the -a flag is given.
