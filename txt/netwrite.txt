 netwrite (in.writed daemon for accepting network "write") 
 
 Writed implements a very simple protocol that allows a write(1) 
 program on one host to connect up to one on another host, allowing 
 communications across the network. Writed is meant to be run from 
 inetd(8) listening for TCP requests on port 811. No attempt is made 
 to determine the authenticity of users sending messages. This 
 program should probably not be deployed on insecure networks.
