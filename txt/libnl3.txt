 libnl3 (Netlink Protocol Library Suite version 3) 
 
 The libnl suite is a collection of libraries providing APIs to 
 netlink protocol based Linux kernel interfaces. 
 Netlink is a IPC mechanism primarily between the kernel and user 
 space processes. It was designed to be a more flexible successor 
 to ioctl to provide mainly networking related kernel configuration 
 and monitoring interfaces.
