 bridge-utils (network Ethernet bridging utilities) 
 
 This package contains utilities for configuring Linux Ethernet 
 bridges. The Linux Ethernet bridge can be used for connecting 
 multiple Ethernet devices together. The connecting is fully 
 transparent. Hosts connected to one Ethernet device see hosts 
 connected through a bridge to the other Ethernet devices directly.
