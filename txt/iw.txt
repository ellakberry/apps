 iw (tool for configuring Linux wireless devices) 
 
 This package contains the `iw' tool which allows you to configure and 
 show information about wireless networking. The tool is currently used 
 for drivers based on the mac80211 stack, but work is under way to make 
 it useful for other wireless drivers as well.
