 mdadm (manage RAID arrays) 
 
 mdadm is a utility program for creating, managing, and monitoring 
 Linux MD (Software RAID) devices. Unlike the older raidtools 
 package, mdadm is a single program (which should make it easier to 
 use). 
 
 mdadm was written by Neil Brown. Development of mdadm is sponsored 
 by CSE@UNSW (The School of Computer Science and Engineering at 
 The University of New South Wales).
