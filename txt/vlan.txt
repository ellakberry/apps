 vlan (VLAN (802.1q) configuration program) 
 
 The vlan package contains the vconfig program, which allows you to 
 create and remove VLAN devices on a VLAN enabled kernel. VLAN 
 devices are virtual Ethernet devices which represent virtual LANs on 
 the physical LAN. 
 
 vlan is primarily the work of Alex Zeffertt, Cambridge Broadband Ltd, 
 extensively rewritten by Ben Greear.
