 p11-kit (PKCS#11 toolkit) 
 
 p11-kit provides a way to load and enumerate PKCS#11 modules. 
 
 It provides a standard configuration setup for installing PKCS#11 
 modules in such a way that they're discoverable. It also solves 
 problems with coordinating the use of PKCS#11 by different components 
 or libraries living in the same process.
