 nn (the NN newsreader) 
 
 nn is an easy to use menu driven newsreader by Kim F. Storm. 
 
 nn stands for "No News is good news", and the nn newsreader is 
 designed to let you minimize the amount of time you spend reading news 
 (or, more realistically, to let you to read even more newsgroups :-). 
 This version of nn reads news from a news server via NNTP, and can 
 make use of your NNTP server's NOV database.
