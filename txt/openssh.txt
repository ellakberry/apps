 openssh (Secure Shell daemon and clients) 
 
 ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and 
 for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to replace 
 rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between 
 two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. sshd (SSH Daemon) is 
 the daemon program for ssh. OpenSSH is based on the last free version 
 of Tatu Ylonen's SSH, further enhanced and cleaned up by Aaron 
 Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt, and 
 Dug Song. It has a homepage at http://www.openssh.com/
