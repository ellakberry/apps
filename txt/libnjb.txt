 libnjb (A library for Creative Nomad related media devices) 
 
 libnjb is a C library and API for communicating with the Creative 
 Nomad JukeBox and Dell DJ digital audio players under BSD, Linux, 
 Mac OS X, and Windows. The protocol these devices use is presumably 
 called PDE (Portable Digital Entertainment protocol) at Creative. 
 Newer devices using the Microsoft MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) 
 are NOT supported.
