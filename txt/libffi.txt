 libffi (A Portable Foreign Function Interface Library) 
 
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function 
 interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code 
 written in one language to call code written in another language. 
 The libffi library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent 
 layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
