 rxvt (terminal emulator) 
 
 rxvt is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as an xterm 
 replacement for users who do not require features such as Tektronix 
 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As a result, rxvt 
 uses much less memory -- a significant advantage on a machine serving 
 many X sessions. Also included is rclock, an analog clock for X.
