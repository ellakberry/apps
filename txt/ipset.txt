 ipset (administration tool for kernel IP sets) 
 
 IP sets are a Linux kernel framework administered by the ipset 
 utility. Depending on the type, currently an IP set may store IP 
 addresses, (TCP/UDP) port numbers, or IP addresses with MAC addresses 
 in a way which ensures lightning speed when matching an entry against 
 a set.
