 time (the GNU time command for measuring program resource use) 
 
 The `time' command runs another program, then displays information 
 about the resources used by that program, collected by the system 
 while the program was running. 
 
 GNU time was originally written by David Keppel, with later versions 
 worked on by David MacKenzie, Arne Henrik Juul, and Francois Pinard.
