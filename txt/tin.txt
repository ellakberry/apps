 tin (the Tin newsreader) 
 
 Tin is a full-screen, easy-to-use Netnews reader. It can read news 
 locally (i.e. /var/spool/news) or remotely (rtin or tin -r option) 
 via a NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server. It will 
 automatically utilize NOV (news overview) style index files if 
 available locally or via the nntp xover command. 
 
 Tin was written by Iain Lea <iain@ecrc.de> and is currently 
 maintained by Urs Janssen <urs@tin.org>.
