 libproxy (proxy configuration library) 
 
 libproxy exists to answer the question: Given a network resource, 
 how do I reach it? It handles all the details, enabling you to get 
 back to programming. Just ask libproxy what proxy to use: you get 
 simple code and your users get correct, consistent behavior and 
 broad infrastructure compatibility.
