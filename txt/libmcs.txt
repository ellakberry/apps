 libmcs (A library for managing configuration settings) 
 
 mcs is a library and set of userland tools which abstract the 
 storage of configuration settings away from userland applications. 
 
 It is hoped that by using mcs, that the applications which use it 
 will generally have a more congruent feeling in regards to settings. 
 
 Because mcs is licenced under the BSD license, it is hoped that 
 many applications will adopt its use.
