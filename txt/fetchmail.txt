 fetchmail (mail retrieval and forwarding utility) 
 
 fetchmail is a mail retrieval and forwarding utility. It fetches 
 mail from a POP, IMAP, or ETRN-capable remote mailserver and forwards 
 it to your local (client) machine's delivery system. You can then 
 handle the retrieved mail using normal mail user agents such as elm, 
 pine, or mutt. The fetchmail utility can be run in a daemon mode to 
 repeatedly poll one or more systems at a specified interval. 
 
 fetchmail is probably not secure.
