 attr (tools for using extended attributes on filesystems) 
 
 This package contains a set of tools for manipulating extended 
 attributes (name:value pairs associated permanently with files and 
 directories) on filesystem objects, and the library and header files 
 needed to develop programs which make use of extended attributes. 
 Extended attributes are used to provide additional functionality to 
 a filesystem. For example, Access Control Lists (ACLs) are 
 implemented using extended attributes.
