 kate (an advanced text editor for KDE) 
 
 The Kate project develops two main products: 
 KatePart, the advanced editor component which is used in numerous KDE 
 applications requiring a text editing component, and Kate, a MDI text 
 editor application. In addition, we provide KWrite, a simple SDI 
 editor shell which allows the user to select his/her favorite editor 
 component.
