 sysvinit (init, the parent of all processes) 
 
 System V style init programs by Miquel van Smoorenburg that control 
 the booting and shutdown of your system. These support a number of 
 system runlevels, each with a specific set of utilities spawned. 
 For example, the normal system runlevel is 3, which starts agetty 
 on virtual consoles tty1 - tty6. Runlevel 4 starts xdm. 
 Runlevel 0 shuts the system down.
