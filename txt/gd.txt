 gd (a graphics library) 
 
 gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images 
 complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from 
 other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or 
 JPEG file. This is particularly useful in web applications, where 
 PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images by 
 most browsers. 
 
 The gd library was written by Thomas Boutell.
