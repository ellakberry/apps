 crda (Central Regulatory Domain Agent) 
 
 This is the Central Regulatory Domain Agent for Linux. 
 It serves one purpose: tell the Linux kernel what to enforce. 
 In essence, it is a udev helper for communication between 
 the kernel and userspace. 
 
 You only need to run this manually for debugging purposes.
