 traceroute (IP packet route tracing utility) 
 
 The traceroute utility displays the route used by IP packets on their 
 way to a specified network host. Traceroute will display the IP 
 number and host name (if possible) of all the machines along the route 
 taken by the packets. If you're having network connectivity problems, 
 traceroute can show you where the trouble is located.
