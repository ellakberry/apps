 lm_sensors (hardware monitoring package) 
 
 lm_sensors provides tools for monitoring the temperatures, voltages, 
 and fans of Linux systems with hardware monitoring devices. Included 
 are text-based tools for sensor reporting, and a library for sensors 
 access called libsensors. It also contains tools for sensor hardware 
 identification and I2C bus probing. 
 
 IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a Thinkpad, please read the warnings in 
 the README.thinkpad file. lm_sensors has been known to cause damage 
 to some Thinkpads.
