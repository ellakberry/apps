 pidentd (TCP/IP IDENT protocol server) 
 
 The identd daemon implements the IDENT protocol as specified in 
 RFC1413. When your machine connects to a remote system, the remote 
 machine may connect to your identd daemon to find out either the 
 user name or other information about the process that initiated 
 the connection. Some remote machines may choose not to allow your 
 connections if you do not provide access to an identd daemon. 
 
 The pidentd daemon was written by Peter Eriksson.
