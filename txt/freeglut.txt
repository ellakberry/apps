 freeglut (alternative GLUT library) 
 
 freeglut is a completely OpenSourced alternative to the OpenGL 
 Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library. GLUT (and hence freeglut) allows 
 the user to create and manage windows containing OpenGL contexts 
 on a wide range of platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard, and 
 joystick functions.
