 desktop-file-utils (Utilities for manipulating desktop files) 
 
 Some utilities from freedesktop.org for handling .desktop files: 
 
 desktop-file-validate: validates a desktop file and prints 
 warnings/errors about spec violations. 
 desktop-file-install: installs a desktop file to the applications 
 directory, optionally munging it a bit in transit. 
 desktop-menu-tool: loads .vfolder-info and .menu files and does 
 operations on them.
