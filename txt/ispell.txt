 ispell (spelling checker) 
 
 Ispell is a fast screen-oriented spelling checker that shows you your 
 errors in the context of the original file, and suggests possible 
 corrections when it can figure them out. Compared to UNIX spell, it 
 is faster and much easier to use. Ispell can also handle languages 
 other than English. Ispell has a long history, and many people have 
 contributed to the current version -- some of the major contributors 
 include R. E. Gorin, Pace Willisson, Walt Buehring, and Geoff 
 Kuenning.
