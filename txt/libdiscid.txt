 libdiscid (library to generate DiscIDs from audio CDs) 
 
 libdiscid creates MusicBrainz DiscIDs from audio CDs. 
 It reads the table of contents (TOC) of a CD and generates 
 an identifier which can be used to lookup the CD at MusicBrainz. 
 Additionally, it provides a submission URL for adding the DiscID 
 to the database.
