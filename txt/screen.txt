 screen (screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation) 
 
 Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical 
 terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). 
 Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal 
 and several control functions from the ISO 6492 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) 
 and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for 
 multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for 
 each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows 
 moving text regions between windows.
