 less (file pager) 
 
 Less is a paginator similar to more (1), but which allows backward 
 movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not 
 have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large 
 input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1). 
 
 Less was written by Mark Nudelman.
