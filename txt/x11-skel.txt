 x11-skel (Miscellaneous things required for X) 
 
 These are some symlinks needed by X11 after moving some files and 
 directories to conform with the Linux FHS. For example, the fonts 
 are now in the /usr/share/fonts directory, and this package makes 
 a symlink to there from /usr/lib/X11/fonts (the default location). 
 An /etc/xdg directory (the default for XDG_CONFIG_DIRS in the 
 XDG Base Directory Specification) is also contained in this package, 
 as well as sample xorg.conf files and other scripts.
