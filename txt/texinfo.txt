 texinfo (GNU software documentation system) 
 
 'Texinfo' is a documentation system that uses a single source file to 
 produce both on-line information and printed output. Using Texinfo, 
 you can create a printed document with the normal features of a book, 
 including chapters, sections, cross references, and indices. From the 
 same Texinfo source file, you can create a menu-driven, on-line Info 
 file with nodes, menus, cross references, and indices. 
 
 This package is needed to read the documentation files in /usr/info.
