 nc (Netcat network utility) 
 
 Netcat, or "nc" as the actual program is named, is a simple utility 
 which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or 
 UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that 
 can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. 
 At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and 
 exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection 
 you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities. 
 Netcat was written by *Hobbit* <hobbit@avian.org>, and is a product 
 of Avian Research. rsy
 rsync (remote file sync) rsy
 rsy
 rsync is a replacement for rcp that has many more features. It rsy
 uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast method for rsy
 bringing remote files into sync. It does this by sending just the rsy
 differences in the files across the link, without requiring that both rsy
 sets of files are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand. rsy
 rsy
 rsync was written by Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras. rsy
