 net-tools (base Linux networking utilities) 
 
 This is the core collection of tools such as "ifconfig" and "route" 
 used to configure networking on Linux. You won't be able to do much 
 networking without this package and the network-scripts. 
 
 The net-tools package was maintained for many years by Phil Blundell 
 and Bernd Eckenfels.
