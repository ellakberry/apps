 cdparanoia (digital audio extraction tool) 
 
 cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, 
 commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'. It reads digital audio data 
 from a Compact Disc and saves it to sound files. cdparanoia has been 
 designed to read correct audio data even using cheap CD-ROM drives 
 prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of streaming. 
 cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that have been 
 damaged in some way.
