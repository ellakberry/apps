 xfsprogs (tools to use the XFS filesystem) 
 
 XFS is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated 
 on the SGI IRIX platform. It is completely multi-threaded, can 
 support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes, 
 variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of 
 Btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance 
 and scalability.
