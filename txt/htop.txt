 htop (ncurses-based interactive process viewer) 
 
 htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer that is similar to 
 the well-known "top" program, but allows to scroll the list vertically 
 and horizontally to see all processes and their full command lines. 
 Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without 
 entering their PIDs. 
 
 htop is developed by Hisham Muhammad.
