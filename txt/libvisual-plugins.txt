 libvisual-plugins (plugins for the libvisual library) 
 
 By itself, libvisual only provides a framework to build upon. The 
 plugins in this package are designed to work with libvisual to allow 
 it to actually do all sorts of interesting visualizations based on 
 metrics gathered as players process audio information data. Plugins 
 can be mixed (more than one run at a time), or morphed from one to 
 another. Other special effects are possible as well. 
 
 Several authors have contributed libvisual-plugins under the GPL.
