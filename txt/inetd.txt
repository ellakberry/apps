 inetd (Internet super-server) 
 
 This is a program to listen for connections on certain Internet 
 sockets and invokes a program to service the request. Essentially, 
 inetd allows running one daemon to invoke several others, reducing 
 load on the system. Many of the network services are run through 
 inetd, so you'll probably need it. 
 
 This version of inetd was ported from OpenBSD.
