 xcb-proto (X protocol C-language Binding protocol descriptions) 
 
 xcb-proto provides the XML-XCB protocol descriptions that libxcb 
 uses to generate the majority of its code and API. We provide them 
 separately from libxcb to allow reuse by other projects, such as 
 additional language bindings, protocol dissectors, or documentation 
 generators.
