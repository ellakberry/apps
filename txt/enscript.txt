 enscript (converts text files to PostScript and other formats) 
 
 Enscript converts text files to PostScript and spools the generated 
 output to a printer or saves it to a file. If no input files are 
 given, enscript processes standard input. Enscript can be extended to 
 handle different output media and it has many options for customizing 
 printouts.
