 transfig (transform .fig files) 
 
 This package contains the binaries to transform .fig files (created by 
 xfig) to some other formats like epsf and LaTeX. If you have 
 installed xfig, you should also install this package if you want to 
 use xfig to create other files than .fig files, which can then be 
 included in your LaTeX documents.
