 netkit-routed (dynamic network routing daemon) 
 
 Routed is invoked at boot time to manage the network routing tables. 
 The routing daemon uses a variant of the Xerox NS Routing Information 
 Protocol in maintaining up to date kernel routing table entries. 
 It used a generalized protocol capable of use with multiple address 
 types, but is currently used only for Internet routing within a 
 cluster of networks. 
 
 Fair warning: routed is no longer maintained and may be insecure.
