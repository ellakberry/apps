 lesstif (a free replacement for OSF/Motif(R)) 
 
 LessTif is the Hungry Programmers' (www.hungry.com) free clone of 
 Motif(R). It aims to be source compatible with OSF/Motif(R) meaning 
 that the same source code should compile with both and work exactly 
 the same. This package contains the libraries and header files to 
 be able to run and compile Motif applications, along with the lesstif 
 version of mwm, the Motif window manager.
