 mkinitrd (make an initial ramdisk) 
 
 mkinitrd is a script to create an initial ramdisk that is loaded at 
 the same time as the kernel. The initial ramdisk may be responsible 
 for loading kernel modules (such a filesystem or SCSI controller 
 module) that are needed to mount the root filesystem. 
 
 The "initrd" is implemented as an initramfs. See the kernel 
 documentation for more information on this, if you are interested.
