 sysklogd (Linux system logging utilities) 
 
 Dr. Greg Wettstein and Stephen Tweedie's syslogd/klogd. 
 
 This package contains a modified version of syslogd for the Linux 
 environment. An additional utility, klogd, is included which allows 
 kernel logging to be directed through the syslogd facility. 
 Syslogd and klogd are started when your system boots.
