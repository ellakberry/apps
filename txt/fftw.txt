 fftw (Fastest Fourier Transform in the West) 
 
 FFTW is a free collection of fast C routines for computing the 
 Discrete Fourier Transform in one or more dimensions. It includes 
 complex, real, symmetric, and parallel transforms, and can handle 
 arbitrary array sizes efficiently. FFTW is typically faster than 
 other publicly-available FFT implementations, and is even 
 competitive with vendor-tuned libraries.
