 ksh (AT&T Korn Shell 93) 
 
 The KornShell language and interactive shell were designed by 
 David G. Korn at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Besides offering a powerful 
 interactive shell, it also offers a robust programming language with 
 such features as associative arrays and built in integer math 
 operations. ksh is an excellent choice for system administration 
 scripts and for everyday interactive use.
