 beforelight (X11 screensaver) 
 
 The beforelight program is a sample implementation of a screen saver 
 for X servers supporting the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension. It is only 
 recommended for use as a code sample, as it does not include features 
 such as screen locking or configurability, and relies on the legacy 
 Xaw toolkit.
