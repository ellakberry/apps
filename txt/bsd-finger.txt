 bsd-finger (user information lookup program) 
 
 The finger displays information about the system users. Finger 
 displays the user's login name, real name, terminal name and write 
 status (as a ``*'' after the terminal name if write permission is 
 denied), idle time, login time, office location and office phone 
 number. 
 
 As fingerd leaks semi-private information about your machine's 
 usernames and other data, fingerd should be used with caution. 
 Allow machines on a need-to-know basis.
