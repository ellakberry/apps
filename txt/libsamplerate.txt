 libsamplerate (a Sample Rate Converter for audio) 
 
 Secret Rabbit Code (aka libsamplerate) is a Sample Rate Converter for 
 audio. One example of where such a thing would be useful is 
 converting audio from the CD sample rate of 44.1kHz to the 48kHz 
 sample rate used by DAT players. SRC is capable of arbitrary and time 
 varying conversions. SRC provides a small set of converters to allow 
 quality to be traded off against computation cost.
