 xsane (Graphical frontend to SANE, Scanner Access Now Easy) 
 
 xsane provides a graphical user-interface to control an image 
 acquisition device such as a flatbed scanner. It allows previewing 
 and scanning individual images and can be invoked either directly 
 from the command-line or through the GIMP image manipulation program. 
 
 xsane accesses image acquisition devices through the SANE (Scanner 
 Access Now Easy) interface.
