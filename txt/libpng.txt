 libpng (Portable Network Graphics library) 
 
 PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an extensible file format for the 
 lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG 
 provides a patent-free replacement for GIF and can also replace many 
 common uses of TIFF. Indexed-color, grayscale, and truecolor images 
 are supported, plus an optional alpha channel. Sample depths range 
 from 1 to 16 bits.
