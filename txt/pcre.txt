 pcre (Perl-compatible regular expression library) 
 
 The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular 
 expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as 
 Perl 5, with just a few differences (documented in the man page). 
 
 The PCRE library is used by KDE's Konqueror browser.
