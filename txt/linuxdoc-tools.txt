 linuxdoc-tools (utilities for working with DocBook and SGML) 
 
 SGML stands for Standard Generalized Markup Language. This is a 
 system which allows you to produce LaTeX, HTML, GNU info, LyX, RTF, 
 and plain text (via groff) from a single source file in SGML. It is 
 often used for technical software documentation, such as the Linux 
 HOWTO documents. 
 
 This package includes everything you need to use SGML -- all of the 
 standard SGML tools; OpenJade; tools for working with DocBook 
 documents (various DTDs); xmlto and AsciiDoc.
