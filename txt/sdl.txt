 sdl (Simple DirectMedia Layer library) 
 
 This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a generic API that provides low 
 level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via 
 OpenGL, and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms. 
 
 SDL links against alsa-lib, arts, audiofile, esound, and the X11 
 libraries. Make sure all of these are installed if you're planning to 
 use SDL (a full installation will cover all of the prerequisites).
