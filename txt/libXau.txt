 libXau (Sample Authorization Protocol for X) 
 
 This is a very simple mechanism for providing individual access to 
 an X Window System display.It uses existing core protocol and library 
 hooks for specifying authorization data in the connection setup block 
 to restrict use of the display to only those clients that show that 
 they know a server-specific key called a "magic cookie."
