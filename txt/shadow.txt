 shadow (shadow password suite) 
 
 This set of login related programs utilizes an alternate, non-readable 
 file to contain the actual encrypted passwords. This is presumed to 
 increase system security by increasing the difficulty with which 
 system crackers obtain encrypted passwords. It was written by 
 Julianne Frances Haugh and the Linux port is maintained by Tomasz 
 Kloczko. 
 
 This package provides 'login', which is needed to log into the system.
