 gettext-tools (internationalization framework tools) 
 
 The GNU gettext-tools package is useful for authors and maintainers of 
 internationalized software, or for anyone compiling programs that 
 use the gettext functions. This package provides the needed tools and 
 library functions for the handling of messages in different languages. 
 Some other GNU packages use the gettext program (included in this 
 package) to internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.
