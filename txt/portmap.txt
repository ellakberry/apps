 portmap (a daemon to manage RPC connections) 
 
 The portmapper (/sbin/rpc.portmap) is a network daemon used to manage 
 connections to RPC services. Daemons that offer RPC services (such 
 as the daemons for NFS) tell the portmapper on what port they listen. 
 Unlike the services registered with the inetd, RPC network port 
 numbers may change each time the system is booted. 
 
 The portmapper is required to use NFS or other RPC services.
