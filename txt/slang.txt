 slang (S-Lang interpreter version 2) 
 
 S-Lang is an interpreted language that was designed from the start 
 to be easily embedded into a program to provide it with a powerful 
 extension language. S-Lang is also a programmer's library that 
 permits a programmer to develop sophisticated platform-independent 
 software. In addition to providing the S-Lang extension language, 
 the library provides facilities for screen management, keymaps, 
 and low-level terminal I/O.
