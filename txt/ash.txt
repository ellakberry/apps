 ash (Kenneth Almquist's ash shell) 
 
 A lightweight (92K) Bourne compatible shell. Great for machines with 
 low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like bash, 
 tcsh, and zsh. Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne 
 shell. Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some 
 bash-specific syntax. The Slackware setup scripts are a notable 
 exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks. NetBSD 
 uses ash as its /bin/sh.

 bash (sh-compatible shell) b
 b
 The GNU Bourne-Again SHell. Bash is a sh-compatible command b
 interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or b
 from a file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn b
 and C shells (ksh and csh). Bash is ultimately intended to be a b
 conformant implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools b
 specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2). b
 b
 Bash must be present for the system to boot properly. b

 mhash (Thread-safe hash library) mh
 mh
 mhash is a thread-safe hash library, implemented in C, and provides a mh
 uniform interface to a large number of hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, mh
 HAVAL, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD160, TIGER, GOST). These algorithms can be mh
 used to compute checksums, message digests, and other signatures. mh
 The HMAC support implements the basics for message authentication, mh
 following RFC 2104. mh
