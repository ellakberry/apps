 oprofile (system profiling tool) 
 
 OProfile is a profiling system for Linux. Profiling runs 
 transparently in the background and profile data can be collected 
 at any time. OProfile makes use of the hardware performance 
 counters provided on Intel, AMD, and other processors, and uses a 
 timer-interrupt based mechanism on CPUs without counters. 
 OProfile can profile the whole system in high detail.
