 gperf (a perfect hash function generator) 
 
 gperf is a perfect hash function generator written in C++. 
 It transforms an n element user-specified keyword set W into a 
 perfect hash function F. gperf currently generates the reserved 
 keyword recognizer for lexical analyzers in several production and 
 research compilers and language processing tools, including GNU C, 
 GNU C++, GNU Java, GNU Pascal, GNU Modula 3, and GNU indent. 
 
 gperf was written by by Douglas C. Schmidt and Bruno Haible.
