 libtool (a generic library support script) 
 
 This is GNU Libtool, a generic library support script. Libtool hides 
 the complexity of using shared libraries behind a consistent, portable 
 interface. To use libtool, add the new generic library building 
 commands to your Makefile, Makefile.in, or Makefile.am. See the 
 documentation for details. 
 
 You must install the "m4" package to be able to use libtool.
