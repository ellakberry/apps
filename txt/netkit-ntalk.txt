 netkit-ntalk (talk client and talkd daemon) 
 
 talk and talkd are the BSD communication client server system for 
 the command line. "talk" is the client that asks another user to 
 respond; and "in.talkd" is the server that notifies a user that 
 someone else wants to initiate a conversation. 
 
 The talk command appeared in 4.2BSD.
