 bash (sh-compatible shell) 
 
 The GNU Bourne-Again SHell. Bash is a sh-compatible command 
 interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or 
 from a file. Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn 
 and C shells (ksh and csh). Bash is ultimately intended to be a 
 conformant implementation of the IEEE Posix Shell and Tools 
 specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2). 
 
 Bash must be present for the system to boot properly.
