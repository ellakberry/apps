 dhcp (DHCP server and client utilities) 
 
 This package provides the ISC's DHCP utilities, including both a 
 server and client. The DHCP protocol allows a host to contact a 
 central server which maintains a list of IP addresses which may be 
 assigned on one or more subnets. A DHCP client may request an 
 address from this pool, and then use it temporarily for communication 
 on the network. The DHCP protocol also provides a mechanism whereby 
 a client can learn important details about the network to which it is 
 attached, such as the location of a default router or name server.
