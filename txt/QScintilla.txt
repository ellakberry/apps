 QScintilla (Qt port of the Scintilla C++ editor control) 
 
 QScintilla includes features especially useful when editing and 
 debugging source code. These include support for syntax styling, 
 error indicators, code completion, and call tips. The selection 
 margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to 
 indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are 
 more open than with many editors, allowing the use of 
 proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and 
 background colours, and multiple fonts.
