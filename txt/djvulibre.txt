 djvulibre (web-centric document and image format) 
 
 DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing 
 documents and images. DjVu content downloads faster, displays and 
 renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client 
 resources than competing formats. DjVu was originally developed at 
 AT&T Labs-Research by Leon Bottou, Yann LeCun, Patrick Haffner, and 
 many others.
