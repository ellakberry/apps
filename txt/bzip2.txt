 bzip2 (a block-sorting file compressor) 
 
 Bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text 
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally 
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional LZ77/LZ78- 
 based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM family of 
 statistical compressors.
