 bootp (BOOTP server) 
 
 This is an enhanced version of the CMU BOOTP server which was derived 
 from the original BOOTP server created by Bill Croft at Stanford. 
 BOOTP allows a network administrator to setup networking information 
 for clients via an /etc/bootptab on a server so that the clients can 
 automatically get their networking information.
