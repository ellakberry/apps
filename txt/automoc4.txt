 automoc4 (automatic moc for Qt4) 
 
 This package contains the automoc4 binary which is used to run moc 
 on the right source files in a Qt 4 or KDE 4 application. 
 Moc is the meta object compiler which is a widely used tool with Qt 
 and creates standard C++ files to provide syntactic sugar of the 
 signal/slots mechanism.
