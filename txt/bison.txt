 bison (parser generator similar to yacc) 
 
 GNU "Bison" is a general-purpose parser generator that converts a 
 grammar description for an LALR(1) context-free grammar into a C 
 program to parse that grammar. 
 
 Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc 
 grammars ought to work with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar 
 with Yacc should be able to use Bison with little trouble.
