 SQLite (simple, self contained database engine) 
 
 SQLite is a small C library that implements a self-contained, 
 embeddable, zero-configuration SQL database engine. 
 
 The SQLite distribution comes with a standalone command-line access 
 program (sqlite) that can be used to administer an SQLite database 
 and which serves as an example of how to use the SQLite library.
