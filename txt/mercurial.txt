 mercurial (a distributed source management system) 
 
 Mercurial is a cross-platform, distributed source management tool for 
 software developers. It is written in Python, with a binary diff 
 implementation written in C. Its major features include high- 
 performance; serverless, fully distributed collaborative development; 
 robust handling of both plain text and binary files; advanced 
 branching and merging capabilities; and full source code available 
 under the terms of the LGPL. 
 
 Mercurial was written by Matt Mackall and other contributors.
