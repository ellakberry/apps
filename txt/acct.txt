 acct (process accounting utilities) 
 
 This is a set of utilities which reports and summarizes data about 
 user connect times and process execution statistics. To activate 
 process accounting, create the log file (touch /var/log/pacct), and 
 then use the accton command to start it (accton /var/log/pacct). 
 Be aware that the log file can grow to be quite large. 
 
 The GNU process accounting utilities were written by Noel Cragg and 
 the software is currently maintained by Ciaran O'Riordan, 
 Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo, and Tim Schmielau. libnetfilter_
