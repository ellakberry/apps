 cpufrequtils (Kernel CPUfreq utilities) 
 
 The cpufrequtils package makes access to the Linux kernel CPUfreq 
 subsystem easier for users and cpufreq userspace tools. It contains 
 a library used by other programs (libcpufreq), and command line tools 
 to determine current CPUfreq settings and to modify them. 
 
 Dominik Brodowski is the cpufrequtils maintainer. 
 The cpufrequtils page is hosted on kernel.org:
