 libxml2 (XML parser library) 
 
 Libxml2 is the XML C parser library and toolkit. XML itself is a 
 metalanguage to design markup languages -- i.e. a text language where 
 structures are added to the content using extra "markup" information 
 enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known markup 
 language. Though the library is written in C, a variety of language 
 bindings make it available in other environments.
