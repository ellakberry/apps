 guile (GNU extension language library) 
 
 This is Guile, Project GNU's extension language library. Guile is an 
 interpreter for Scheme, packaged as a library that you can link into 
 your applications to give them their own scripting language. Guile 
 will eventually support other languages as well, giving users of 
 Guile-based applications a choice of languages.
