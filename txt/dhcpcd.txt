 dhcpcd (DHCP client daemon) 
 
 The DHCP client program dhcpcd is used to connect to a network by 
 contacting a DHCP server. dhcpcd gets an IP address and other 
 information from a corresponding DHCP server, configures the network 
 interface automatically, and tries to renew the lease time according 
 to RFC2131 or RFC1541 depending on the command line option.
