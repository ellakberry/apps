 libtheora (Theora video codec library) 
 
 Theora is Xiph.Org's first publicly released video codec, intended 
 for use within the Foundation's Ogg multimedia streaming system. 
 
 The Theora bitstream format was frozen after the alpha3 release. This 
 means that files produced by the alpha3 encoder will always be 
 playable according to the Theora I specification. Traditionally 
 alpha means a proof of concept, not a production-ready release. 
 However the code is very robust, ready for and indeed in general use.
