 libxcb (X protocol C-language Binding) 
 
 The XCB library provides an interface to the X Window System protocol 
 which is fully capable of replacing Xlib. In fact, libX11 makes use 
 of libxcb as much as possible. :-) Porting to XCB has several 
 advantages such as a smaller memory footprint, latency hiding, direct 
 protocol access, and improved thread support.
