 netkit-rusers (show users logged in to machines on local network) 
 
 The rusers command produces output similar to who, but for the list 
 of hosts or all machines on the local network. For each host 
 responding to the rusers query, the hostname with the names of the 
 users currently logged on is printed on each line. The rusers 
 command will wait for one minute to catch late responders. 
 
 Portmap and rpc.rusersd must be running on remote machines. Should 
 probably be considered insecure (or at least ill-advised) on public 
 networks.
