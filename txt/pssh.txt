 pssh (tools for collective remote system management) 
 
 Pssh, a.k.a. "parallel ssh", are Python-written wrapper scripts for 
 OpenSSH and rsync tools. They are useful for simultaneous control 
 of large number of machines, using parallel ssh sessions. Included 
 are parallel versions of ssh, scp, and rsync, as well as a parallel 
 kill command. 
 
 Pssh has been written by Brent Chun <bnc at theether.org>, and is 
 currently maintained by Andrew McNabb <amcnabb at mcnabbs.org>.
