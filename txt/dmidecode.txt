 dmidecode (DMI table decoder) 
 
 dmidecode is a tool for dumping a computer's DMI table (some say 
 SMBIOS) contents in a human-readable format. This table contains a 
 description of the system's hardware components, as well as other 
 useful pieces of information such as serial numbers and BIOS 
 revision. 
 
 dmidecode was written by Alan Cox and Jean Delvare.
