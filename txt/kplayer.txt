 kplayer (KDE media player) 
 
 KPlayer is a KDE multimedia player. With KPlayer you can easily play 
 a wide variety of video and audio files and streams using a rich and 
 friendly interface that follows KDE standards. 
 KPlayer will work out of the box if properly installed, and because 
 it uses MPlayer as the media playing backend, it will play virtually 
 any file or Internet stream.
