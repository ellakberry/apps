 iptables (IP packet filter administration) 
 
 iptables is a packet filter administration tool. 
 
 Iptables can be used to build internet firewalls based on stateless 
 and stateful packet filtering, use NAT and masquerading for sharing 
 internet access if you don't have enough public IP addresses, use NAT 
 to implement transparent proxies, aid the tc and iproute2 systems 
 used to build sophisticated QoS and policy routers, do further packet 
 manipulation (mangling) like altering the TOS/DSCP/ECN bits of the IP 
 header, and much more. See: http://www.netfilter.org
