 slacktrack (Slackware package building utilities) 
 
 slacktrack tracks the installation of a 'make install' (or similar) 
 and produces a Slackware compliant package from the results. 
 
 slacktrack can be used to build packages from Slackware's '.build' 
 scripts or your own. 
 
 slacktrack tracks installations directly on the host's filesystem.
