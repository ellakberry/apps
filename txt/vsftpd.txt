 vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Daemon) 
 
 vsftpd is an FTP server, or daemon. The 'vs' stands for Very Secure. 
 Obviously this is not a guarantee, but a reflection that the entire 
 codebase was written with security in mind, and carefully designed to 
 be resilient to attack (as well as extremely fast and scalable).

 The Very Secure FTP Daemon was written by Chris Evans.
