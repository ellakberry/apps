 strigi (fast and light desktop search engine) 
 
 Strigi is a fast and light desktop search engine. It can handle a 
 large range of file formats such as emails, office documents, media 
 files, and file archives. It can index files that are embedded in 
 other files. This means email attachments and files in zip files 
 are searchable as if they were normal files on your harddisk.
