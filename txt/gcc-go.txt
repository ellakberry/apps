 gcc-go (Go support for GCC) 
 
 Go is a compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent programming language 
 developed by Google Inc. The initial design of Go was started in 
 September 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
 Rob Pike has stated that Go is being used "for real stuff" at Google. 
 Go's "gc" compiler targets the Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and 
 Microsoft Windows operating systems, and the i386, amd64, and ARM 
 processor architectures.
