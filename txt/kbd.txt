 kbd (keyboard maps and console fonts) 
 
 Load and save keyboard mappings. Needed if you are not using the US 
 keyboard map. This package also contains utilities to change your 
 console fonts - if you install it you'll get a menu later on that lets 
 you select from many different fonts. If you like one, you can make 
 it your default font. A new default font can be chosen at any time by 
 typing 'setconsolefont'.
