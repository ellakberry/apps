 Linux kernel modules for the Marvell Kirkwood series. 
 
 A kernel module is a piece of object code that can be dynamically 
 loaded into the Linux kernel to provide new kernel functions. Most of 
 these modules provide support for devices such as CD-ROM drives, tape 
 drives, and ethernet cards. You can choose which modules to load by 
 editing /etc/rc.d/rc.modules. 
 
 This package contains Kernel modules for the Marvell Kirkwood 
 family of ARM devices.
