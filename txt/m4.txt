 m4 (an implementation of the UNIX macro processor) 
 
 This is GNU m4, a program which copies its input to the output, 
 expanding macros as it goes. m4 has built-in functions for including 
 named files, running commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating 
 text in various ways, recursion, etc... Macros can also be user- 
 defined, and can take any number of arguments.
