 hfsutils (HFS volume utilities) 
 
 hfsutils is a collection of tools for reading and writing Macintosh 
 HFS volumes. These utilities can manipulate HFS volumes on nearly any 
 medium. Since hfs and xhfs are linked with Tcl/Tk shared libraries, 
 the hfsutils package is included here in the TCL software series.
