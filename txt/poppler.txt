 poppler (a library for rendering PDF documents) 
 
 Poppler is a library based on the xpdf PDF viewer developed by Derek 
 Noonburg of Glyph and Cog, LLC. Since xpdf does not provide a shared 
 library, whenever a flaw was found potentially dozens of applications 
 incorporating code from xpdf would have to be patched. By providing 
 a centralized PDF library this duplicated effort will be eliminated.
