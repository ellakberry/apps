 libcap (get/set POSIX capabilities) 
 
 This is a library for getting and setting POSIX.1e (formerly POSIX 6) 
 draft 15 capabilities. 
 
 Libcap was written by Andrew G. Morgan; however, it would not 
 have been possible without the help of Aleph1, Roland Buresund, 
 Andrew Main, and Alexander Kjeldaas.
