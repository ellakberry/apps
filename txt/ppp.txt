 ppp (Point-to-Point Protocol) 
 
 The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting 
 data over serial links. It's commonly used for connecting to the 
 Internet using a modem. This package includes the PPP daemon (pppd), 
 which negotiates with the peer to establish the link and sets up the 
 ppp network interface, and pppsetup, an easy-to-use utility for 
 setting up your PPP daemon.
