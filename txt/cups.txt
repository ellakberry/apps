 CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) 
 
 The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for 
 UNIX(R)-like operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software 
 Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors 
 and users. CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the 
 basis for managing print jobs and queues. The CUPS package includes 
 System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a PostScript RIP 
 package for supporting non-PostScript printer drivers, and tools for 
 creating additional printer drivers and other CUPS services.
