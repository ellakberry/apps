 gv (PS/PDF file viewer) 
 
 gv is a PostScript and PDF previewer. It allows users to view and 
 navigate through PostScript and PDF documents on an X display by 
 providing a user interface for the ghostscript interpreter. 
 
 gv was written by Johannes Plass, using the source code for Tim 
 Theisen's ghostview 1.5 as a starting point.
