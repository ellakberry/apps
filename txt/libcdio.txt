 libcdio (GNU CD access library) 
 
 The libcdio package contains a library for CD-ROM and CD image access. 
 Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS and device-dependent 
 properties of a CD-ROM or of the specific details of various CD-image 
 formats may benefit from using this library. A library for working 
 with ISO-9660 filesystems libiso9660 is included. A generic interface 
 for issuing MMC (multimedia commands) is also part of the libcdio 
 library.
