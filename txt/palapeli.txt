 palapeli (jigsaw puzzle game) 
 
 Palapeli is a single-player jigsaw puzzle game. 
 Unlike other games in that genre, you are not limited to aligning 
 pieces on imaginary grids. The pieces are freely moveable. 
 Also, Palapeli features real persistency, i.e. everything you do 
 is saved on your disk immediately.
