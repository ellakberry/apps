 doxygen (documentation generator) 
 
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, IDL, and to some 
 extent PHP and C#. Doxygen generates project documentation using 
 special documentation blocks in the source code, easing the process of 
 keeping docs and code in sync. Doxygen produces documentation in 
 several output formats, including HTML, LaTeX, man pages, RTF, XML, 
 compressed HTML, PostScript, and PDF.
