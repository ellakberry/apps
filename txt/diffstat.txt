 diffstat (produces statistics from diff output) 
 
 DiffStat is a simple filter that reads the output of the 'diff' 
 program and displays a histogram of insertions, deletions, and 
 modifications per-file. It is useful for reviewing large, complex 
 patch files. 
 
 Thomas E. Dickey is the author of DiffStat.
