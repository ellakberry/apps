 foomatic-filters (Universal print filter/RIP wrapper) 
 
 foomatic-rip is a universal print filter, which is used by CUPS with 
 the gutenprint and hplip printer drivers. It translates PostScript 
 (and also other file formats) to the printer's native language, 
 usually using Ghostscript (gs) as the external renderer. The way 
 this translation is done is described in a PPD file.
