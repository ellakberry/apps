 elvis (text editor) 
 
 Elvis is a text editor. It is intended to be a modern replacement 
 for the classic ex/vi editor of UNIX fame. Elvis supports many new 
 features, including multiple edit buffers, multiple windows, and a 
 variety of display modes. 
 
 As elvis is Slackware's default vi, this is a required package.
