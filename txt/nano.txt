 nano (Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone) 
 
 nano is a small, free, and friendly editor from the GNU project. It 
 aims to copy Pico's look and feel while providing additional (or 
 disabled by default) features that are missing from Pico, such as 
 "search and replace" or "go to line and column number". 
 
 Chris Allegretta is Nano's author.
