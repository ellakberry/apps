 ncompress (the classic *nix compression utility) 
 
 Compress reduces the size of the named files using adaptive Lempel-Ziv 
 coding. Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the 
 extension .Z, while keeping the same ownership modes, access and 
 modification times. If no files are specified, the standard input is 
 compressed to the standard output. Compressed files can be restored 
 to their original form using uncompress or zcat.
