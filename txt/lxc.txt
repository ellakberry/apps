 lxc (Linux Containers) 
 
 Linux Containers (LXC) are an operating system-level virtualization 
 method for running multiple isolated server installs (containers) on 
 a single control host. LXC does not provide a virtual machine, but 
 rather provides a virtual environment that has its own process and 
 network space. It is similar to a chroot, but offers more isolation. 
 
 Daniel Lezcano is the primary developer of lxc.
