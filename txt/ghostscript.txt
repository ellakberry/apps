 ghostscript (Postscript and PDF interpreter) 
 
 Ghostscript is an interpreter of Adobe Systems' PostScript(tm) 
 and Portable Document Format (PDF) languages. Ghostscript is an 
 essential part of the printing subsystem, taking PostScript output 
 from applications and converting it into an appropriate printer or 
 display format. Ghostscript supports many printers directly, and 
 more are supported through add-on packages.
