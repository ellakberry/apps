 libexif (Exchangeable Image File Format library) 
 
 EXIF stands for Exchangeable Image File Format, which is a format used 
 to store extra information in images such as the JPEG files produced 
 by digital cameras. The libexif library allows programs such as 
 gthumb to parse, edit, and save EXIF data.
