 netkit-ftp (the old BSD FTP client) 
 
 Ftp is the user interface to the Internet standard File Transfer 
 Protocol. The program allows a user to transfer files to and from a 
 remote network site. 
 
 This is a program of mostly historical value. For a more powerful 
 command-line FTP client, look at something like lftp.
