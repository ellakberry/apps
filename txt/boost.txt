 boost (Boost C++ Libraries) 
 
 Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. 
 The emphasis is on libraries that work well with the C++ Standard 
 Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and provide 
 reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are suitable 
 for eventual standardization.
