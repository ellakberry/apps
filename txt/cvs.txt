 cvs (Concurrent Versions System) 
 
 CVS is a version control system, which allows you to keep old versions 
 of files (usually source code), keep a log of who, when, and why 
 changes occurred, etc., like RCS or SCCS. It handles multiple 
 developers, multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control 
 various operations, and can work over a wide area network. 
 
 Some of the people who have worked on CVS include: Dick Grune, 
 Brian Berliner, Jeff Polk, and others too numerous to mention.
