 open-cobol (open source COBOL compiler) 
 
 OpenCOBOL is an open-source COBOL compiler. OpenCOBOL implements a 
 substantial part of the COBOL 85 and COBOL 2002 standards, as well as 
 many extensions of the existent COBOL compilers. OpenCOBOL translates 
 COBOL into C and compiles the translated code using the native C 
 compiler. OpenCOBOL was written by Roger While and Keisuke Nishida, 
 with the invaluable assistance of many others.
