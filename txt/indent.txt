 indent (changes the appearance of a C program) 
 
 GNU indent changes the appearance of a C program by inserting or 
 deleting whitespace according to a plethora of options. Some canned 
 styles of formatting (like the GNU style, Kernighan & Ritchie style, 
 and original Berkeley style) are supported as well. 
 
 GNU indent is a descendant of BSD indent.
