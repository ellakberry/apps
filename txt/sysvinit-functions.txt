 sysvinit-functions (/etc/init.d/functions) 
 
 This is the /etc/init.d/functions file, the typical sysvinit-style 
 directories, and a few supporting binaries. Using this system, 
 subdirectories of /etc/rc.d/ are searched for scripts (which are 
 usually symlinks to the script in /etc/init.d/ or /etc/rc.d/init.d/). 
 The links must start with S to start a script or K to stop (kill) it. 
 
 For the most part, these are useful for running software developed 
 for other versions of Linux.
