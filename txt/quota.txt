 quota (Linux disk quota utilities) 
 
 An implementation of the diskquota system for the Linux operating 
 system to keep those greedy users from gobbling up 100% of the hard 
 drive space. Works with ext2, ext3, reiserfs, and xfs filesystems. 
 This system is based on the Melbourne quota system by Robert Elz. 
 Edvard Tuinder and Marco van Wieringen ported this code to Linux. 
 Jan Kara added support for the new Linux quota format and the XFS 
 filesystem.
