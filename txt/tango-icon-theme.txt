 Tango icon theme (Another standard icon theme) 
 
 The Tango Desktop Project has designed a basic set of desktop icons 
 that follow the style guidelines. The set has been created as a 
 proof of concept for the style, but works rather well as a replacement 
 for the base theme under GNOME and KDE.
