 aaa_terminfo (a basic collection of terminfo entries) 
 
 This is a starter set of files from the terminfo database, which 
 should be enough in most cases. The complete set (from which this 
 is derived) can be found in the ncurses package. 
 
 The terminfo database describes the characteristics of terminals, so 
 don't try to log in without this package. :-)
